# Changelog

## 2.2.0 (unreleased)

### Added

- Now you can access the params used in a method directly from the callback function (`on('method', (params) => ...)`). You can also add types to the params in the `on` method. Currently, the only really type safe way to do this is by passing a type to the generic, instead of directly typing `params`, in this way: `on<MyType>('method', (params) => ...)`. Also, you can't pass interfaces, just types.
- When a method that does not exist is called, an error will be thrown, indicating the misspelled method.

### Fixed

- Before this update, the `params` method would return just the first parameter. Now it returns the correct parameters. 

## 2.1.0

### Added

- Result score.
- More types to the parameters.
- `dontHideAfterAction`: prevents the query window from closing when the action is fired (useful when using the method `Flow.Launcher.ChangeQuery` with the `requery` parameter set to `true`).

### Fixed

- An error caused by sending empty parameters to Flow. Now, by default, if no param is provided, sends an empty array.

## 2.0.0

### Added

- The `flow` function is now a class `Flow`.
- It is now possible to type the methods.
